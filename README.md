# Peace for Pandas

  ## Description
  Our motivation in building this site was to bring awareness to the conservation of Pandas and their environment. We built this project to provide a space for people to learn about pandas and post their thoughts about pandas. This project solves the problem of not having a site dedicated to learning about pandas and interacting with like minded individuals. We learned a lot about MERN and how the back-end interacts with the front-end.
