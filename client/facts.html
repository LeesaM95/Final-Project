                        A panda's  diet often consists of leaves, and the stems and shoots of bamboo. Bamboo does not contain much nutritional value, so pandas often have to eat between 12 and 38 kilograms (26 to 83 pounds) of food every day.

                        The average panda is about 2-3 feet tall when on all four paws, or 4-6 feet when standing on their hind legs. They also weigh between 68 and 100 kilograms. (150 and 220 pounds). Panda’s have developed a thick coat of fur to keep warm in the mountains and forests they live in. They also have large molars and strong jaws in order to eat bamboo, their primary food source.
